# LLD Interview Questions Research Plan

## Objective
Create a comprehensive list of Low Level Design interview questions to help candidates prepare for technical interviews.

## Research Steps
- [ ] Research common LLD interview topics and question categories
- [ ] Gather specific LLD question examples from different domains
- [ ] Organize questions by complexity level (junior/mid/senior)
- [ ] Categorize questions by system type (web services, databases, algorithms, etc.)
- [ ] Include questions covering all aspects from the LLD template
- [ ] Create a structured question bank with explanations
- [ ] Verify completeness against the LLD template requirements

## Research Areas
